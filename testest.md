<p>

We hypothesize that understanding the density of pet-owning households per pet supply store, as well as the total customer spend on Chewy products per capita &mdash;and how those metrics have changed since March 2020 (the start of the pandemic)&mdash;will allow us to determine an ideal location for the fulfillment center.

**Primary impact:** determine an ideal location for the fulfillment center <br>
**Secondary impacts:** prevent extra fulfillment spend (and therefore, increase net profits), decrease the fraction of late deliveries (i.e., longer than the promised, three-day delivery), decrease average order delivery time, increase customer satisfaction
